# First Steps with Geo and GeoPostGIS in Phoenix Framework 1.3

Simple demo that allows a user to:

- Enter Latitude and Logitude values
- Submit location to database
- List 'inspect' view of Geo.Point values contained in database

Not production quality by any means, but may help demystify a few issues I personally ran into.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
